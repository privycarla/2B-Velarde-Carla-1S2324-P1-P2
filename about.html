    <h3><b>ABOUT MUNICIPALITY OF DAANBANTAYAN</b></h3>
        <br>
        <h1><b>OLD DAANBANTAYAN MUNICIPALITY</b></h1>
        
           <p><b>Daanbantayan Municipality</b> is one of the attractive areas in Cebu Province. One of its greatest gifts are the islands with white beaches and crystal-clear waters. Part of the municipality is the one <b>‘mysteriously’</b> called Malapascua (<i>‘mal’</i> bad and <i>‘Pascua’</i> Christmas in Spanish) Island. It is endowed with great beaches where locals enjoy their laid-back lifestyle, while many resorts offer exciting facilities and services to island visitors.</p>
           <p><b>Daanbantayan Municipality</b> is part of Cebu Province located on the northern tip of the island. This municipality is ranked as first municipal income class of this Visayan province. The most recent census <b>(2015)</b> indicated that Daanbantayan has over 80 thousand registered residents and around half of them are registered, voters. In Cebuano language, <b>‘daan’</b> could mean <b>‘old’</b> (or <b>‘road’</b>) in the English language. I said that ‘daan’ could be a translation for ‘road’ because most native Cebuanos pronounce <b>‘dalan’</b> (without letter ‘l’) as <b>‘daan,’</b> a tendency to lengthen the accent due to the deletion of letter <b>‘l.’</b>Moreover, <b>‘Bantayan’</b> would most possibly refer to the watchtower (called ‘baluarte) in the municipality which is also found in many places especially on the southern side of the province. Some research results mentioned that there are around 22 extant watchtowers and a total of over 70 were built during the Spanish period.In short, we can say that <b>‘daan’</b> plus <b>‘Bantayan’</b> could mean <b></b>‘an old watchtower’</b> (where watchers, such as soldiers or civilians could watch or signal incoming pirates).</p>
